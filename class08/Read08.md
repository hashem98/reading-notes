# SOLID: The First 5 Principles of Object Oriented Design


SOLID stands for these 5 principle which these design guidelines,  will tend to steer you toward writing clean code

## Single-Responsibility Principle

 * a class should have only one job

## Open-Closed Principle

* Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
* it's like  app store in your phone which you can extend the phone's capabilities to allow you to manage your todo list, play inane video games, and even serve as a flashlight or wireless access point

## Liskov Substitution Principle

* Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
* that means any child type of a parent type should be able to stand in for that parent without things blowing up.

## Interface Segregation Principle

* A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

## Dependency Inversion Principle

* Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.

* the dependency inversion principle (dip) encourages you to write code that depends upon abstractions rather than upon concrete details

>SOLID principles will help you to downgrade complications.
